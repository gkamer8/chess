# chess

Homemade chess engine.

## General implementation

The file chess.cpp contains main and begins by prompting the user for a color. Then, a board object is instantiated along with a cpu object (constructed with the color and board object). Turns alternate between the player and the CPU. Moves are inputted with algebraic notation.
